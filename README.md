# BOSP: Adaptive Execution Model porting of "OpenCV Delaunay2"

This repo contains the src code of a porting of the OpenCV sample,
delaunay2.cpp, (available at this
[link](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/delaunay2.cpp)
to the Adaptive Execution Model used by the framework Barbeque Run-Time
Resource Manager (BarbequeRTRM) (more info
[here](https://bosp.deib.polimi.it))<br/>

1. To can build the application it is necessary to have OpenCV library
installed on the machine.<br/> 
3. The default installation path for the BarbequeRTRM is ~/BOSP<br/>
4. Once the application is built just run it in the bosp shell using the
command "delaunay2", or "delaunay2 -h" for help<br/>
<br/>
